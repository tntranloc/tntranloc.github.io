        <p> I'm originally from Vietnam and currently based in Germany for my PhD study. Inititally trained as a molecular plant biologist, I was later attracted to the theoretical and computational side of biology. Hence, I pursue a PhD where we aim to bring classical quantitative genetics and modern molecular genetics under the same proof to explore plant adaptive and breeding potential. </p>
        <p> I thrive in a supportive and well-organized work environment. After work, I recharge myself with music playing, literature, and drawing. <p>
