description: In this internship, with the great tutor of my supervisor at that time, Axel Touw, I got to explore different concepts of ecology and plant defense system to biotic factors, namely root fly and root-knot nematode. We looked at the gene expression profile as well as the changes in different glucosinolate compounds (secondary metabolites) at different time points of infestation/infection. Furthermore, we looked at how herbivores affect each other's performance via plant-mediated responses. Manscript is currently under review.
