description: In this project, I characterised a novel transcription factor called KUODA, which was presumably responsible for cell elongation during seed development. I was mainly involved in cloning and sequencing five members of KUODA family. The study was performed on model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which was to be extrapolated into sugar beet system later on.
