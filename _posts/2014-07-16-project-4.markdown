description: Many pieces of research have been emphasising on plant defence responses to dual or multiple attacks at both ecological and molecular levels. In Brassica rapa, glucosinolates (GSLs) are one of the most predominant defence compounds against root herbivores and other biotic enemies in general. Under normal conditions, GSLs profiles would follow optimal defence theory (ODT), speculating that plants would invest their defences on the most valuable and vulnerable organs. Upon certain attacks, plants can defend directly or indirectly, of which the latter can create a so-called plant-mediated interaction among different organisms. Taking these together, we questioned how this orchestration would change when plants are exposed to a multitude of biotic enemies, and how this would influence the interrelation among the attackers. In the light of this ecological aspect and ODT, we set up a performance assay to observe the performance of cabbage root flies Delia radicum (D. radicum) in Brassica rapa plant with prior infection by root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (M. incognita). Next, we looked further into the modulation of GSLs profile and the molecular mechanisms to account for the observations at the performance level. We found that infection by M. incognita promoted the survival rate of mature adult D. radicum. In terms of defence distribution, benzyl GSLs did not change in the dual treatment with D. radicum and M. incognita. Taproot accumulated indole GSLs via biosynthesis pathways upon D. radicum feeding, whereas fine roots recruited aliphatic and indole GSLs during the nematode infection, mostly through GSL transporters. The activities and coordination of the candidate genes for GSLs orchestration are still far from conclusive. We hope our study encourages follow-up studies on phytohormonal and nutrient attributes in the interplay of plants and their biotic enemies.
