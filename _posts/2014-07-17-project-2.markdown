description: In this project we characterised natural variation in heat-induced secondary dormancy using a collection of 362 European Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We discovered how seed age modulates secondary dormancy and the associated quantitative trait loci. We also revealed a latitudinal pattern of secondary dormancy which reflects adaptation to heat and drough along the gradient. This study shows a complex adaptive mechanism helping plants undergoing future climate change.
